 *      Description: SPI Master (STM) and SPI Slave (Arduino) communication
 *      		  	 When the button on the master is pressed, master should send string
 *      		  	 of data to the Arduino slave connected. The data received by
 *      		  	 the Arduino will be displayed on the Arduino serial port
 *      		  	 1. Use full SPI full duplex mode
 *      		  	 2. ST board will be in SPI master mode and Arduino will be
 *      		  	    configured for SPI Slave mode
 *      		  	 3. Use DFF = 0;
 *      			 4. Use hardware slave management (SSM = 0)
 *
 *      			 Note: In this exercise, master is not going to receive anything from the slave.
 *      			       Thus, the master's MISO can be disabled
 *
 *      			  	   Slave does not know how many bytes of data master is going to send.
 *      			  	   So master first sends the number bytes info which slaves is going to
 *      			  	   receive next.
