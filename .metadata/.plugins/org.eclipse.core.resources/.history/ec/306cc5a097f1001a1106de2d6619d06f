 *      Description: I2C Master(STM) and I2C Slave(Arduino) communication.
 *      			 When button on the master is pressed, master should send data to the
 *      			 Arduino slave connected. The data received by the Arduino will
 *      			 be displayed on the Arduino serial port
 *      			 1. Use I2C SCL = 100kHz (Standard mode)
 *      			 2. Use internal pull-up resistor for SDA and SCL lines
